      Economics is a social science devoted to the study of how people and societies get what they need and want. Or, in more formal language, economics is the study of how societies divide and use their resources to produce goods and services and of how those goods and services are then distributed and consumed.
      Resources are the basic ingredients that are needed to produce the goods and services that people buy. These ingredients can be physical things such as land and factory equipment, and they can be intangible things such as the intellectual and emotional capacities of people, whose work is necessary for the production of goods and services. Whether a society is rich or poor, large or small, resources are, from the viewpoint of economics, scarce. This means that almost everyone in every country would like more goods and services than can ever be produced. Given a limited supply of resources and an unlimited desire on the part of individual consumers and nations, choices must be made about what goods and services to produce, how to produce them, and for whom.
      Economists study these often-difficult choices and their significance. They come up with theories about how such choices are made on both individual and collective levels, and they try to make predictions and find solutions to a wide range of societal problems.
      Although thinkers in earlier societies sometimes addressed topics that today concern economists, economics as a field did not emerge until after the Middle Ages (a period that lasted from about 500 to 1500), when capitalism became a firmly established economic system. (In capitalism the economy is controlled by private individuals rather than the government.) Much of economic theory grew out of the ideas of Scottish philosopher Adam Smith, whose book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776) is generally considered the founding text of the field of economics. Later, as a result of the writings of English economist John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s, economics came to be subdivided into two main branches, microeconomics and macroeconomics. These branches focus, respectively, on individual and collective economic behavior. Since Keynes’s time many economists have worked on unifying these two branches of theory.
      Throughout history many philosophers and religious thinkers have dealt with economic questions. In ancient Greece, for instance, the philosophers Plato and Aristotle addressed the issue of whether private property was a legitimate concept. Likewise, in the thirteenth century the Italian Christian philosopher Thomas Aquinas discussed the moral aspects of buying and selling goods and services. For much of history, religions such as Christianity and Islam opposed, on moral grounds, such economic trends as the charging of interest (fees paid to those who lend money). But the study of economics did not become systematic until after the Middle Ages.
      In the sixteenth through eighteenth centuries, the nation-states of Europe (such as England, France, Spain, and Portugal) wanted to build up power partly by amassing wealth. Out of this desire grew economic theories that dictated the development of capitalism during that time. These theories, later grouped together under the label of mercantilism, generally held that a nation’s wealth was equivalent to its store of gold, silver, and other precious metals. This belief led nations to pursue wealth by maintaining an imbalance in foreign trade. If a nation sold more goods abroad than it imported, then that nation would bring in more gold than it would send outside of its borders through trade. In this way, the developing European nations competed with each other by trying to stockpile gold.
      In the eighteenth century Adam Smith (1723–90) conceived of his book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations as a rebuttal to the mercantilist viewpoint, but it was much more than that. Smith argued that a nation’s wealth should be measured not just by its horde of gold but also by all of the goods and services that it produces. He also examined the nature of that enormously sophisticated production of goods and services. One of his guiding insights was the notion of the “invisible hand.” This was the concept that, in a situation where buyers and sellers compete freely in the marketplace for what is in their own self-interest, the greatest good for all is consistently achieved, as if by the prodding of an invisible hand. The marketplace, in Smith’s view, was a self-regulating system in which market prices were determined by the forces of supply (what the sellers want) and demand (what the buyers want).
      This, together with Smith’s many other crucial insights into the ways that societies use their resources, served as the foundation for much of the economic thought of the nineteenth century. Even in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, economists continued to refine and reconsider Smith’s ideas in new ways.

      Nations and businesses that trade back and forth, buy and sell companies, loan one another money, and invest in real estate around the globe need to have a way to evaluate the impact of these transactions on the economy. They need to make decisions about trade policies, regulations, and trade agreements, and until they can get a snapshot of what global trade is doing to hurt or help its economy, they can’t make these decisions.
      It’s a lot like your own finances, just on a much larger scale. At the end of the month, have you spent more than you earned? Do you have a large positive balance in your bank account as a result of receiving a financial aid check? Did you need to borrow money from your parents to buy books or clothes? Until you really examine where your money is coming from and balance your checkbook, it’s hard to make long-term financial plans—like, say, deciding whether or not to buy a new car or purchase a home.
      This is very similar to what countries do when they measure the impact of trade on their economy. In this section, we’ll look at two key measurements of trade: balance of trade and balance of payments.
      One of the ways that a country measures global trade is by calculating its balance of trade.
      Balance of trade is the difference between the value of a country’s imports and its exports, as follows:
      
      value of exports – value of imports = balance of trade
      
      The calculation of the balance of trade yields one of two outcomes: a trade deficit or a trade surplus. A trade deficit occurs when a nation imports more than it exports. Since 1976, the United States has consistently run trade deficits due to high imports of oil and consumer products. In recent years, the biggest trade deficits were recorded with China, Japan, Germany, and Mexico. This shouldn’t come as a surprise to you if you emptied your backpack and counted up all the items not made in the United States. In contrast, a trade surplus occurs when a nation exports more than it imports. Although the United States has run an overall trade deficit since 1976, it doesn’t mean that we import more from every country than we export. On the contrary, the United States records trade surpluses with Hong Kong, the Netherlands, the United Arab Emirates, and Australia.
      Because the balance of trade is calculated using all imports and exports, it’s possible for the United States to run a surplus with some nations and a deficit with others. As with your checkbook, the balance reflects the difference between total exports (sales, which result in a deposit in your account or “deposits”) and total imports (purchases, which result in a withdrawal from your account or “withdrawals”). When a nation exports, other nations pay it for goods or services, so it gets to take their money and make a deposit. When a nation imports, it pays other nations for their goods and services, and they would need to make a withdrawal to pay for them.
      
      Balance of Payments is the difference between the total flow of money coming into a country and the total flow of money going out of a country during a period of time. Although related to the balance of trade, balance of payments is the record of all economic transactions between individuals, firms, and the government and the rest of the world in a particular period. Thus the balance of payments includes all external transactions of a country, including payments for the country’s exports and imports of goods, services, foreign investments, loans and foreign aid, financial capital, and financial transfers.
      For instance, if a U.S. company buys land or a factory in another country, that investment is included in the U.S. balance of payments as an outflow. Likewise, if a U.S. company is sold to a foreign company, it’s included in the balance of payments. Just recently, Didi Chuxing, the Chinese ride-hailing service, bought Uber’s subsidiary in China in a deal valued at $35 billion. This sale will create a cash inflow to the United States, but over the long term, it will decrease the revenue flowing in from China through Uber.
      If a nation receives foreign aid or borrows money from another country, this amount is also reflected in its balance of payments as a cash inflow. For example, the bailout Greece received from the Eurozone and IMF in 2010 to help stabilize its failing economy affected the balance of payments for all of the nations involved. Greece recorded the €110 billion loan as an inflow in its balance of payments, while the Eurozone members recorded it as an outflow in their balance of payments.
      A country’s balance of payments is calculated as follows:
      
      total money coming into a country (inflow) − total money going out (outflow) = balance of payments

      At this point, it’s tempting to make judgments about these different types of trade measurements and conclude that trade surpluses and favorable balance of payments are always indicators of a strong economy, but unfortunately it’s not so cut and dry. Balance of trade and balance of payments are starting points—much in the way that an individual’s credit rating might be a starting point for seeking a loan. How the numbers are interpreted and viewed by the country’s leaders, other countries, and the world depends on many factors, such as where a country is in its economic development, the factors contributing to the balance of trade or payments, the health of the overall global economy, what the country is doing with its imports, and so on. As you might guess, assessments of these factors can be intensely political. You’ll learn more about these considerations later in this module when we discuss how nations attempt to restrict or control trade.

      The government can influence markets and its citizens in many ways. Two of these types of tools are taxes and subsidies. Let's start off by establishing the difference between taxes and subsidies!
      Taxes are a charge the government imposes on individuals' and firms' income and revenue. At the same time, subsidies are grants or tax breaks given to individuals and firms to incentivize them to pursue a social objective that the government that issues the subsidy wishes to promote.
      These policies shift the supply or demand curve depending on who and how they're implemented.

      Taxes are monetary costs levied by governments on individuals and firms that are collected from their income or revenue to be transferred to the public sector.

      Subsidies are direct and indirect payments provided by the government to individuals and firms to give the recipients a financial incentive to pursue a certain objective.

      How does the differences between taxes and subsidies affect the outcome of a policy? Taxes and subsidies are two financial mechanisms the government uses; we'll cover why these exist and what implications they have for the government, citizens, and businesses.
      Taxes are the mechanism by which governments collect funds from their constituents to provide public services and address market failures. Commonly taxes are the way to provide necessary structures that the market may struggle to provide universally; these things can range from public defense, police, firefighters, healthcare, mail services, and roads.
      While government handling market failures is inefficient as it is not subject to competition, government-controlled markets aim to provide more socially equitable outcomes than productively efficient ones.
      The majority of criticisms of taxes and government spending come from the non-universal benefits that the government provides; services vital to one aspect of a community may do nothing for another, who then see it as a waste of money.
      However, all citizens benefit to some degree from the government's management of things like roads, weather events, and trash services. Services provided by the government save citizens time and effort that can be quantified, such as a shorter commute due to well-maintained and efficient roads.
      Businesses benefit from government tax expenditures in various ways, whether providing support to their labor pool or infrastructure and roads for their business. While businesses are taxed heavily, it is common for them to receive some tax relief through loopholes.
      Additionally, governments may address market fluctuations by providing subsidies that are paid for by taxation. The benefits we receive from taxation often aren't seen in the dollar value they provide us. Check out this example below to learn more.

      Subsidies are a financial tool regulators use to address market failures. The collection of taxes pays for subsidies.
      Commonplace areas that receive subsidies range from healthcare, unemployment assistance, fossil fuel, agriculture, and housing.
      The government intervenes in these instances, as the free market does not always provide a low enough cost for enough citizens. Governments can provide subsidies through tax reduction, buying surplus, loans, or cash.
      The most popular uses of subsidies worldwide protect food production and agricultural industries. Countries guard their food supply to maintain autonomy. Governments can pay farmers for each product which will lower prices for consumers, or provide low-interest loans to help farmers get through tough growing seasons.
      These government interventions are bad for competition and disrupt the free market's natural efficiency. However, they may provide a more equitable and stable market, or at least they try to. Consumers benefit from subsidies paid to businesses directly; read this example to learn more.
    
      Taxes and subsidies have many uses and far-reaching implications for all aspects of our economy. Part of an economist's job is to measure the effectiveness of these policies.

      Policies like taxes and subsidies can alter supply significantly; the difference occurs whether it's used to correct competitive forces or address externalities, the market will shift accordingly. Policies can affect supply whether they're placed on producers or consumers, as changes in demand will change the equilibrium between Supply and Demand.

      Determinants of supply and taxes and subsidies
      Determinants of supply are many factors that affect a firm's quantity and price supplied. Check out this list below to see major factors that affect supply.
      Price of a good - Price changes has a direct supply and demand response.
      Price of substitute goods - Changes in the price or quality of competing goods.
      Price of inputs - Changes in the cost of production.
      Competitive forces - The more competition in the market, the more sharply supply is affected.
      Technology - Changes in technology affect productivity and the cost of production.
      When a subsidy is applied, this is a benefit to the suppliers, receiving either a reduction in cost or cash. Either way, the subsidy is distributed, and it will increase returns for producers. Producers supply a quantity where marginal revenue (MR) equals Marginal Cost (MC); the subsidy raises marginal revenue, allowing producers to increase to a higher quantity. On a graph, this would appear as a rightward shift in the supply curve.
      When a tax is imposed on suppliers, this increases their operating costs which will limit their production. Like above, they produce to MR=MC; however, the Marginal Cost is higher due to the tax. This means that firms' production quantities will not be too costly at higher quantity levels, so they will have to reduce the quantity to match the increased cost. A tax like this will shift supply to the left, resulting in lower quantity supplied and higher prices.
    
      t doesn't need to be said that consumption is taxed, as anyone who bought anything already knows. It may not seem like it, but demand often receives subsidies in various forms from the government, whether it's unemployment benefits or tax breaks for energy efficiency. Government interventions can affect demand even when imposed on producers, as changing the supply curve alters the equilibrium point with demand.
      A subsidy can affect demand in multiple ways, usually for the better in the short run. A subsidy can make goods cheaper or more available, whether the subsidy is given to consumers or producers. A subsidy to consumers, such as the Covid-19 stimulus checks, increases disposable income, shifting the demand curve to the right. A rightward shift means an increase in quantity demanded and willingness to pay.
      For as long as anyone has been alive, we've witnessed taxes affecting demand for sales, gas, or property. Any tax decreases disposable income and shifts the demand curve leftward, reducing the quantity demanded and lowering the willingness to pay higher prices.

      National income is the value of the aggregate output of the different sectors during a certain time period. In other words, it is the flow of goods and services produced in an economy in a particular year. Thus, the measurement of National Income becomes important.
      There are three ways of measuring the National Income of a country. They are from the income side, the output side and the expenditure side. Thus, we can classify these perspectives into the following methods of measurement of National Income.

      1. Product Method
      Under this method, we add the values of output produced or services rendered by the different sectors of the economy during the year in order to calculate the National Income.
      In this method, we include only the value added by each firm in the production process in the output figure.
      Hence, we use the value-added method. The value-added output of all the sectors of the economy is the GNP at factor cost.
      However, this method is unscientific as it adds the value of only those goods and services that are sold in the market or are available for sale in the market

      2. Income Method
      Under this method, we add all the incomes from employment and ownership of assets before taxation received from all the production activities in an economy.
      Thus, it is also the Factor Income method. We also need to add the undistributed profits of the private sector and the trading surplus of the public sector corporations.
      However, we need to exclude items not arising from productive activities such as sickness benefits, interest on the national debt, etc.

      3. Expenditure Method
      This method measures the total domestic expenditure of the economy. It consists of two elements, viz. Consumption expenditure and Investment expenditure.
      Consumption expenditure includes consumption expenditure of the household sector on goods and services and consumption outlays of the business sector and public authorities
      Investment expenditure refers to the expenditure on the making of fixed capital such as Plant and Machinery, buildings, etc.
    
      Difficulties in Measurement of National Income

      Following are the difficulties in estimating the National Income

      1. Conceptual difficulties
      2. Statistical difficulties

      1. Conceptual difficulties
      It is difficult to calculate the value of some of the items such as services rendered for free and goods that are to be sold but are used for self-consumption.
      Sometimes, it becomes difficult to make a clear distinction between primary, intermediate and final goods.
      What price to choose to determine the monetary value of a National Product is always a difficult question?
      Whether to include the income of the foreign companies in the National Income or not because they emit a major part of their income outside India?
      
      2. Statistical difficulties
      In case of changes in the price level, we need to use the Index numbers which have their own inherent limitations.
      Statistical figures are not always accurate as they are based on the sample surveys. Also, all the data are not often available.
      All the countries have different methods of estimating National Income. Thus, it is not easily comparable.

      As investors, it’s important for us to understand both accounting and economic concepts, like the equilibrium level of income -- it makes us better at choosing good companies that can go the distance. For us, the law of supply and demand is everything, so when a company makes the same amount of product as is in demand, that’s financial nirvana.
      So if your favorite company makes snack cakes, and they’ve somehow managed to crack the code on just how many snack cakes it takes to perfectly satisfy consumer demand, they’re neither spending extra money on storing excess snack cakes nor spending a lot of extra money trying to keep up with demand. All things are in perfect balance.
    
      How to calculate the equilibrium level of income

      The equilibrium level of income is often calculated at a much larger economic level than an individual company, which brings a lot of other factors into play. Put simply, the equilibrium level of income is defined as aggregate supply (AS) = aggregate demand (AD).
      But how do we calculate AS or AD in the private sector?
      Aggregate demand is equal to consumption (C) plus investment (I); aggregate supply is equal to consumption (C) plus saving (S). So if AS = AD, then C + I = C + S.
      If you want a wider look at how the bigger picture factors in, we can change aggregate supply to a variable called national income, represented by (Y). The national income is assumed to be mostly spent on the consumption of goods and services, with the remainder saved. We can also flush out aggregate demand more fully to include government expenditure (G) and net export (X – M), where X is total export, and M is total import for a country.
      In that case, the equilibrium level of income formula would look like this:

      Y = C + I + G + (X – M)

      But of course, if you’re not exporting or importing anything, you can simplify this to Y = C + I + G.
      For most domestic investors, C + I = C + S should get the job done.

      Why does the equilibrium level of income matter?

      The equilibrium level of income may not matter for every investor, but those who are involved in the production of goods will want to pay close attention to this concept. The equilibrium level of income is a perfect ideal, a point where everything is in balance, and all the machinery is running without any loss or waste.
      Because of that, it’s also a point where labor and supplies are in perfect balance. Your company, at equilibrium, has everything it needs and nothing it doesn’t need to fulfill a perfect level of demand where there’s no reason to store extra, throw anything away, or discount any product. Of course, this never happens, but it’s a goal, and one that you can look to to determine the efficiency of your particular manufacturing investments.
      A company where the equilibrium level of income is heavy on the demand side and light on the supply side is a company that needs to scramble to find workers, is hurting for raw materials, or both. It may be forced to pay extra for those things just to continue to meet consumer demand.
    
      A company where the equilibrium level of income is heavy on the supply side is storing products away in warehouses that cost money to operate and maintain and sometimes discounting those products deeply just to move them (or, in the case of snack cakes, paying to dispose of them).
      Imbalance in the equilibrium level of income can be a good economic indicator for the wider economy, however, since these companies are putting their money into paying more labor and buying more goods, which can translate into more spending, more taxes paid to governments by workers, and so forth. But it’s not generally directly great for your investment.
    
      The equilibrium level of income can be a difficult equation to calculate, but it’s a pretty simple concept to understand. When there’s balance, it’s a great thing for investors, and when there’s not… well, something is going to suffer somewhere. At the end of the day, the more closely a company meets demand with appropriate supply, the happier everyone is, including investors who don’t have to worry that their company is wasting a lot of money on inefficiencies.

      Monetary policy is a set of tools used by a nation's central bank to control the overall money supply and promote economic growth and employ strategies such as revising interest rates and changing bank reserve requirements.
      In the United States, the Federal Reserve Bank implements monetary policy through a dual mandate to achieve maximum employment while keeping inflation in check.
    
      • Monetary policy is a set of actions to control a nation's overall money supply and achieve economic growth.
      • Monetary policy strategies include revising interest rates and changing bank reserve requirements.
      • Monetary policy is commonly classified as either expansionary or contractionary.
      • The Federal Reserve commonly uses three strategies for monetary policy including reserve requirements, the discount rate, and open market operations.
    
      Understanding Monetary Policy
      Monetary policy is the control of the quantity of money available in an economy and the channels by which new money is supplied.
      Economic statistics such as gross domestic product (GDP), the rate of inflation, and industry and sector-specific growth rates influence monetary policy strategy.
      A central bank may revise the interest rates it charges to loan money to the nation's banks. As rates rise or fall, financial institutions adjust rates for their customers such as businesses or home buyers.
      Additionally, it may buy or sell government bonds, target foreign exchange rates, and revise the amount of cash that the banks are required to maintain as reserves.
    
      Types of Monetary Policy
      Monetary policies are seen as either expansionary or contractionary depending on the level of growth or stagnation within the economy.
      
      Contractionary
      
      A contractionary policy increases interest rates and limits the outstanding money supply to slow growth and decrease inflation, where the prices of goods and services in an economy rise and reduce the purchasing power of money.
      
      Expansionary
      
      During times of slowdown or a recession, an expansionary policy grows economic activity. By lowering interest rates, saving becomes less attractive, and consumer spending and borrowing increase.
    
      Goals of Monetary Policy

      Inflation
      Contractionary monetary policy is used to temper inflation and reduce the level of money circulating in the economy. Expansionary monetary policy fosters inflationary pressure and increases the amount of money in circulation.

      Unemployment
      An expansionary monetary policy decreases unemployment as a higher money supply and attractive interest rates stimulate business activities and expansion of the job market.

      Exchange Rates
      The exchange rates between domestic and foreign currencies can be affected by monetary policy. With an increase in the money supply, the domestic currency becomes cheaper than its foreign exchange.
    
      Tools of Monetary Policy

      Open Market Operations
      In open market operations (OMO), the Federal Reserve Bank buys bonds from investors or sells additional bonds to investors to change the number of outstanding government securities and money available to the economy as a whole.
      The objective of OMOs is to adjust the level of reserve balances to manipulate the short-term interest rates and that affect other interest rates.

      Interest Rates
      The central bank may change the interest rates or the required collateral that it demands. In the U.S., this rate is known as the discount rate. Banks will loan more or less freely depending on this interest rate.

      Reserve Requirements
      Authorities can manipulate the reserve requirements, the funds that banks must retain as a proportion of the deposits made by their customers to ensure that they can meet their liabilities.

      Lowering this reserve requirement releases more capital for the banks to offer loans or buy other assets. Increasing the requirement curtails bank lending and slows growth.

      Fiscal policy refers to the use of government spending and tax policies to influence economic conditions, especially macroeconomic conditions. These include aggregate demand for goods and services, employment, inflation, and economic growth.
      During a recession, the government may lower tax rates or increase spending to encourage demand and spur economic activity. Conversely, to combat inflation, it may raise rates or cut spending to cool down the economy.
      Fiscal policy is often contrasted with monetary policy, which is enacted by central bankers and not elected government officials.

      • Fiscal policy refers to the use of government spending and tax policies to influence economic conditions.
      • Fiscal policy is largely based on ideas from British economist John Maynard Keynes.
      • Keynes argued that governments could stabilize the business cycle and regulate economic output rather than let markets right themselves alone.
      • An expansionary fiscal policy lowers tax rates or increases spending to increase aggregate demand and fuel economic growth.
      • A contractionary fiscal policy raises rates or cuts spending to prevent or reduce inflation.
    
      Understanding Fiscal Policy
      U.S. fiscal policy is largely based on the ideas of British economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946). He argued that economic recessions are due to a deficiency in the consumer spending and business investment components of aggregate demand.
      Keynes believed that governments could stabilize the business cycle and regulate economic output by adjusting spending and tax policies to make up for the shortfalls of the private sector.
      His theories were developed in response to the Great Depression, which defied classical economics' assumptions that economic swings were self-correcting. Keynes' ideas were highly influential and led to the New Deal in the U.S., which involved massive spending on public works projects and social welfare programs.
      In Keynesian economics, aggregate demand or spending is what drives the performance and growth of the economy. Aggregate demand is made up of consumer spending, business investment spending, net government spending, and net exports.

      Variable Private Sector Behavior
      According to Keynesian economists, the private sector components of aggregate demand are too variable and too dependent on psychological and emotional factors to maintain sustained growth in the economy.
      Pessimism, fear, and uncertainty among consumers and businesses can lead to economic recessions and depressions. What's more, excessive public sector exuberance during good times can lead to an overheated economy and inflation.
      However, Keynesians believe that government taxation and spending can be managed rationally and used to counteract the excesses and deficiencies of private sector consumption and investment spending in order to stabilize the economy.
      
      Corrective Government Fiscal Action
      When private sector spending decreases, the government can spend more and/or tax less in order to directly increase aggregate demand. When the private sector is overly optimistic and spends too much, too fast on consumption and new investment projects, the government can spend less and/or tax more in order to decrease aggregate demand. 
      This means that to help stabilize the economy, the government should run large budget deficits during economic downturns and run budget surpluses when the economy is growing. These are known as expansionary or contractionary fiscal policies, respectively.  
    
      Types of Fiscal Policies

      Expansionary Policy and Tools
      To illustrate how the government can use fiscal policy to affect the economy, consider an economy that's experiencing a recession. The government might issue tax stimulus rebates to increase aggregate demand and fuel economic growth. 
      The logic behind this approach is that when people pay lower taxes, they have more money to spend or invest, which fuels higher demand. That demand leads firms to hire more, decreasing unemployment, and causing fierce competition for labor. In turn, this serves to raise wages and provide consumers with more income to spend and invest. It's a virtuous cycle or positive feedback loop. 
      Alternately, rather than lowering taxes, the government may seek economic expansion by increasing spending (without corresponding tax increases). Building more highways, for example, could increase employment, pushing up demand and growth.
      Expansionary fiscal policy is usually characterized by deficit spending. Deficit spending occurs when government expenditures exceed receipts from taxes and other sources. In practice, deficit spending tends to result from a combination of tax cuts and higher spending.

      Contractionary Policy and Tools
      In the face of mounting inflation and other expansionary symptoms, a government can pursue contractionary fiscal policy, perhaps even to the extent of inducing a brief recession in order to restore balance to the economic cycle.
      The government does this by increasing taxes, reducing public spending, and cutting public sector pay or jobs.
      Where expansionary fiscal policy involves spending deficits, contractionary fiscal policy is characterized by budget surpluses. This policy is rarely used, however, as it is hugely unpopular politically.
      Public policymakers thus face differing incentives relating to whether to engage in expansionary or contractionary fiscal policy. Therefore, the preferred tool for reining in unsustainable growth is usually a contractionary monetary policy. Monetary policy involves the Federal Reserve raising interest rates and restraining the supply of money and credit in order to rein in inflation.
    
      Downside of Expansionary Policy
      
      Mounting deficits are among the complaints lodged against expansionary fiscal policy. Critics complain that a flood of government red ink can weigh on growth and eventually create the need for damaging austerity.
      Many economists simply dispute the effectiveness of expansionary fiscal policies. They argue that government spending too easily crowds out investment by the private sector.
      Expansionary policy is also popular—to a dangerous degree, say some economists. Fiscal stimulus is politically difficult to reverse. Whether it has the desired macroeconomic effects or not, voters like low taxes and public spending.
      Due to the political incentives faced by policymakers, there tends to be a consistent bias toward engaging in more-or-less constant deficit spending that can be in part rationalized as good for the economy. 
      Eventually, economic expansion can get out of hand. Rising wages lead to inflation and asset bubbles begin to form. High inflation and the risk of widespread defaults when debt bubbles burst can badly damage the economy. This risk, in turn, leads governments (or their central banks) to reverse course and attempt to contract the economy.

      Fiscal Policy vs. Monetary Policy
      Fiscal policy is the responsibility of the government. It involves spurring or slowing economic activity using taxes and government spending.
      Monetary policy is the domain of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board and refers to actions taken to increase or decrease liquidity through the nation's money supply. According to the Federal Reserve Board, these actions are intended to "promote maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates—the economic goals the Congress has instructed the Federal Reserve to pursue."
      The monetary policy tools that the Fed uses to increase or decrease liquidity (and affect consumer spending and borrowing) include:
      • Buying or selling securities on the open market
      • Lending to depository institutions through its discount window
      • Raising or lowering the discount rate
      • Raising or lowering the federal funds rate
      • Establishing reserve requirements for banks
      • Engaging in central bank liquidity swaps
      • Financing through overnight repurchase agreements

      Who Handles Fiscal Policy?
      In the United States, fiscal policy is directed by both the executive and legislative branches. In the executive branch, the two most influential offices in this regard belong to the President and the Secretary of the Treasury, although contemporary presidents often rely on a Council of Economic Advisers as well.
      In the legislative branch, the U.S. Congress authorizes taxes, passes laws, and appropriations spending for any fiscal policy measures through its power of the purse. This process involves participation, deliberation, and approval from both the House of Representatives and the Senate.

      What Are the Main Tools of Fiscal Policy?
      Fiscal policy tools are used by governments to influence the economy. These primarily include changes to levels of taxation and government spending. To stimulate growth, taxes are lowered and spending is increased. This often involves borrowing by issuing government debt. To cool down an overheating economy, taxes may be raised and spending decreased.

      How Does Fiscal Policy Affect People?
      Often, the effects of fiscal policy aren't felt equally by everyone. Depending on the political orientations and goals of the policymakers, a tax cut could affect only the middle class, which is typically the largest economic group. In times of economic decline and rising taxation, this same group may have to pay more taxes than the wealthier upper class.
      Similarly, when a government decides to adjust its spending, its policy may affect only a specific group of people. A decision to build a new bridge, for example, will give work and more income to hundreds of construction workers. A decision to spend money on building a new space shuttle, on the other hand, benefits only a small, specialized pool of experts and firms, which would not do much to increase aggregate employment levels.
      
      Should the Government Be Getting Involved With the Economy?
      One of the biggest obstacles facing policymakers is deciding how much direct involvement the government should have in the economy and individuals' economic lives. Indeed, there have been various degrees of interference by the government over the history of the United States. For the most part, it is accepted that a certain degree of government involvement is necessary to sustain a vibrant economy, on which the economic well-being of the population depends.

      Fiscal policy is directed by the U.S. government with the goal of maintaining a healthy economy. The tools used to promote beneficial economic activity are adjustments to tax rates and government spending.
      When economic activity slows or deteriorates, the government may try to improve it by reducing taxes or increasing its spending on various government programs.
      When the economy is overly active and inflation threatens, it may increase taxes or reduce spending. However, neither is palatable to politicians seeking to stay in office. Thus, at such times, the government looks to the Fed to take monetary policy action to reduce inflation.

      The contestable market theory is an economic concept stating that companies with few rivals behave in a competitive manner when the market they operate in has weak barriers to entry. The theory assumes that even in a monopoly or oligopoly, incumbents will act competitively when there is a lack of barriers, such as government regulation and high entry costs, doing everything they can to prevent new entrants from one day putting them out of business.

      • The contestable market theory states that companies with few rivals behave in a competitive manner when the market they operate in has weak barriers to entry.
      • The continuous risk of new entrants emerging and stealing market share leads incumbents to focus more on maximizing sales rather than profits.
      • They realize that if they are too profitable, an entrant could easily come and undercut their business.

      How Contestable Market Theory Works
      Contestable in economics means that a company can be challenged or contested by rival companies looking to enter the industry or market. In other words, a contestable market is a market where companies can enter and leave freely with low sunk costs.
      According to contestable market theory, when access to technology is equal and barriers to entry are weak, low, or non-existent, there is a constant threat that new competitors will enter the marketplace and challenge the existing, well-established companies.
      The continuous risk of contestability weighs on the companies that already operate in the space, keeping them on their toes and influencing how they conduct business. Such an environment generally keeps prices low and prevents monopolies from forming.

      Characteristics of a contestable market include:
      • There are no barriers to entry or exit barriers
      • There are no sunk costs: costs that have already been incurred and cannot be recovered
      • Both incumbent companies and new entrants have access to the same level of technology

      Contestable Market Theory Methods
      In a contestable market, entrants might execute a hit-and-run strategy. The new entrants can "hit" the market, given there are no or low barriers to entry, make profits, and then "run," without incurring any exit costs.
      These types of risks play on the minds of the executive management teams within the industry, leading them to adjust their business strategies and gravitate toward sales maximization rather than profit maximization. According to the theory, unlimited profits would be pushed down to normal profits in a truly contestable market.
      Consequently, even a monopoly might be forced to operate competitively if barriers to entry are weak. Those operating a monopoly might conclude that if they're too profitable, a competitor could easily enter the market, contest their business, and undercut their profits.
    
      History of Contestable Market Theory
      The contestable market theory was introduced to the world by economist William J. Baumol in 1982, via his book: Contestable Markets and the Theory of Industrial Structure. Baumol argued that contestable markets always yield competitive equilibrium due to the continuous threat of new entrants.

      Limitations of Contestable Market Theory
      The requisites for a perfectly contestable market are hard to come by. It is seldom easy for an upstart to enter another company’s turf and immediately find itself on a level playing field.
      Costs to enter and exit a market are rarely minimal, while factors such as economies of scale almost always reward companies that have been around for longer.

      Special Considerations
      Aspects of contestable market theory heavily influence the views and methods of government regulators. That's because opening up a market to potential new entrants may be sufficient to encourage efficiency and discourage anti-competitive behavior.
      For example, regulators may force existing companies to open-up their infrastructure to potential entrants or to share technology. This approach of increasing contestability is common in the communications industries, where incumbents are likely to have significant power or control over the network and infrastructure.

      Market failure, in economics, is a situation defined by an inefficient distribution of goods and services in the free market. In an ideally functioning market, the forces of supply and demand balance each other out, with a change in one side of the equation leading to a change in price that maintains the market's equilibrium. In a market failure, however, something interferes with this balance.
      When markets fail, the individual incentives for rational behavior do not lead to rational outcomes for the group. In other words, each individual makes the correct decision for themselves, but those prove to be the wrong decisions for the group as a whole.
    
      • Market failure refers to the inefficient allocation of resources that occurs when individuals acting in rational self-interest produce a less-than-optimal outcome.
      • Market failure can occur in explicit markets where goods and services are bought and sold outright, or in implicit markets such as elections or the legislative process.
      • It may be possible to correct market failures using private market solutions, government-imposed solutions, or voluntary collective actions.
    
      Understanding Market Failure
      A market failure refers to the inefficient distribution of resources that occurs when the individuals in a group end up worse off than if they had not acted in rational self-interest. In the case of a market failure, the overall group incurs too many costs or receives too few benefits. The economic outcomes under market failure deviate from what economists usually consider optimal and are usually not economically efficient.
      Contrary to what the name implies, market failure does not describe imperfections just in the market economy—there can be market failures in government activity, too. One noteworthy example is rent seeking by special interest groups.
      Special interest groups can benefit by lobbying for small costs on everyone else, such as through a tariff. When each small group imposes its costs, the whole group is worse off than if no lobbying had taken place.
      Not every bad outcome from market activity counts as a market failure. In addition, while correcting the imbalances underlying a market failure often requires government intervention, private-market actors may also be able to solve the problem. On the flip side, not all market failures have a potential solution, even with prudent regulation or extra public awareness.

      Causes of Market Failure
      There are many types of imbalances that can affect the equilibrium of the markets. The following list provides an overview of some common causes of market failure.
      • Externalities: Externalities occur when the consumption of a good or service benefits or harms a third party. Pollution resulting from the production of certain goods is an example of a negative externality that can hurt individuals and communities. The collateral damage caused by negative externalities may lead to market failure.
      • Information failure: When there is insufficient information available to certain participants in the market, this can also be the source of market failure. If the buyer or seller in a transaction lacks access to the information on which the price is based, they may be willing to overpay or undercharge for a good or service, disrupting the market's equilibrium.
      • Market control: When one party has too much control over a market, this can also create imbalanced pricing and lead to market failure.
      • In the case of a monopoly or oligopoly, a single seller or a small group of sellers can manipulate pricing. In other situations, known as monopsony or oligopsony, it is the buyers that have the advantage. In either case, the disrupted balance of supply and demand could cause market failure.
      • Public goods: Public goods are another example of market failure because they defy the tenets of supply and demand that drive the free markets. Public goods and services are nonexcludable—once something like a street light is produced, it is accessible to everyone, and the producer cannot limit consumption only to paying customers. Public goods are also non rival, as use by one individual does not limit consumption by others. Given these characteristics, the private sector has little incentive to produce public goods, which leads to market failure, and the government usually has to provide these goods or subsidize their production.
    
      Solutions to Market Failure
      There are many potential solutions for market failure. These can take the form of private market solutions, government-imposed solutions, or voluntary collective action solutions.
      • Private market solutions: In some instances, the solution to a market failure may emerge within the private market itself. For example, asymmetrical information could be solved by intermediaries or rating agencies such as Moody's and Standard & Poor's informing market participants about securities risk. Underwriters Laboratories LLC performs the same task for electronics. Negative externalities such as pollution may be solved with tort lawsuits that increase opportunity costs for the polluter. Radio broadcasts elegantly solved the non-excludable problem by packaging periodic paid advertisements with the free broadcast.
      • Government-imposed solutions: When the solution does not come from the market itself, governments can enact legislation and take other measures as a response to a market failure. For example, if businesses hire too few low-skilled workers after a minimum wage increase, the government can create exceptions for less-skilled workers. Governments can also impose taxes and subsidies as possible solutions. Subsidies can help encourage behavior that can result in positive externalities. Meanwhile, taxation can help cut down negative behavior. For example, placing a tax on tobacco can increase the cost of consumption, therefore making it more expensive for people to smoke. Shepsle, Kenneth A. and Weingast, Barry R. “Political Solutions to Market Problems.” American Political Science Review, vol. 78, no. 2, June 1984, pp. 417–434.
      • Collective action solutions: While the government may have the upper hand in developing legislative, tax, or regulatory solutions, private collective action can also help solve the market failure. Parties can privately agree to limit consumption and enforce rules among themselves to overcome the market failure of the tragedy of the commons. Consumers and producers can band together to form co-ops to provide services that otherwise might be underprovided in a pure market, such as a utility co-op for electric service to rural homes or a co-operatively held refrigerated storage facility for a group of dairy farmers to chill their milk at an efficient scale.
    
      What Are Common Types of Market Failures?
      Types of market failures include negative externalities, monopolies, inefficiencies in production and allocation, incomplete information, and inequality.

      How Can Market Failure Be Corrected?
      The primary means by which market failure can be corrected is through government intervention. This requires the government to pass legislation such as antitrust policies and to incorporate various price mechanisms such as taxes and subsidies.

      Is Poverty a Market Failure?
      Poverty is considered to be a result of market failure. When a recession hits, the poverty rate increases because employees lose their jobs or lose working hours, which results in no income or less income. Inequality, which is a component of market failure, can eventually lead to poverty when wealth is not distributed equally throughout society. This can be remedied with government intervention, such as by taxing the wealthy more or incorporating subsidies for those below the poverty level.

      The Bottom Line
      Market failure refers to inefficient allocation of resources in the free market that occurs when individuals acting in rational self-interest generate less-than-optimal economic outcomes. These economic inefficiencies may occur in explicit markets where goods and services are exchanged, or in implicit markets such as the exchange of favors in the legislative process.
      The causes underlying market failures include negative externalities, incomplete information, concentrated market power, inefficiencies in production and allocation, and inequality. Government intervention such as taxes and subsidies may be effective in solving market failures, while other solutions may emerge within the private market or through collective actions.

      Price elasticity of supply is the responsiveness of a supply of a good or service after a change in its market price. According to basic economic theory, the supply of a good will increase when its price rises. Conversely, the supply of a good will decrease when its price decreases. This happens because producers want to take advantage of a rise in price, so they increase production of their goods and services until demand is exceeded—at which time prices begin to fall. Producers then decrease output to match the price decline.
      Goods and services can be either elastic or inelastic. Elastic means the product is considered sensitive to price changes—luxury goods and non-necessary items fall into this category. Inelastic means the product is not sensitive to price movements—food and gas are examples of inelastic supply goods.

      • Price elasticity of supply indicates how quickly producers shift production levels in response to price changes.
      • Economic theory predicts that when prices rise, producers will want to increase the quantity supplied to sell more at higher prices.
      • If producers cannot cope with increasing demand, prices may continue to rise as quantity cannot keep up.
    
      To find an item's PES, you need to know the percent change in quantity supplied and the percent change in its price.

      PES = %CS ÷ %CP
      where:
      PES = Price elasticity of supply
      CS = Change in supply
      CP = Change in price      ​
      
      So, imagine you have a farm that can produce and deliver 500 bushels of corn per quarter. The price for one bushel in the first quarter was $157.56. In the second quarter, one bushel was $159.25, and your farm produced and delivered 505 bushels.

      First, determine the percent change in price:

      • $159.25 - $157.56 = 1.69
      • 1.69 ÷ $157.56 = 0.0107
      • 0.0107 x 100 = 1.07%
      • Then, the percent change in supply:

      • 505 - 500 = 5
      • 5 ÷ 500 = 0.01
      • 0.01 x 100 = 1.0%

      Use the formula to calculate price elasticity:

      • 1.0% ÷ 1.07% = 0.000107

      A result of 0.0001 shows that your farm's corn price elasticity of supply is very low or inelastic. But if your farm produced 525 bushels in the second quarter, the elasticity would change:

      • 525 - 500 = 25
      • 25 ÷ 500 = 0.05, or 5%
      • 1.0% ÷ 5% = 0.2

      Elasticity of Supply Possibilities
      Price elasticity of supply has five possibilities:

      • Perfectly elastic: The result is an infinite number
      • Elastic: The result is less than one
      • Unitary: The result equals one
      • Inelastic: The result is greater than one
      • Perfectly inelastic: The result is equal to zero.

      So, if the corn from your farm has a price elasticity of supply equal to 0.2, it is elastic.

      Perfectly Elastic Supply
      The PES for perfectly elastic supply is infinite, where the quantity supplied is unlimited at a given price, but no quantity can be supplied at any other price. There are virtually no real-life examples of this, where even a small change in price would dissuade or disallow product makers from supplying even a single product.
    
      Elastic Supply
      A price elasticity supply greater than one means supply is relatively elastic, where the quantity supplied changes by a larger percentage than the price change. An example would be a product that’s easy to make and distribute, such as a fidget spinner. The resources to make additional spinners are readily available, and the total cost would be minimal to ramp production up or down.

      Unitary Elastic Supply
      Unitary Elasticity Supply has a PES of one, where the quantity supplied changes by the same percentage as the price change.
    
      Inelastic Supply
      The PES for relatively inelastic supply is between zero and one. That means the percentage change in quantity supplied changes by a lower percentage than the percentage of price change. An inelastic example is nuclear power, which has a long lead time given the construction, technical know-how, and long ramp-up process for plants.
    
      Perfectly Inelastic Supply
      Perfectly inelastic supply is when the PES formula equals zero. That is, there is no change in quantity supplied when the price changes. Examples include products that have limited quantities, such as land or a painting from deceased artists. The amount of gold on earth, for instance, is finite, as is the number of bitcoins ever to be mined. As a result, at some point, there cannot be an increase in supply regardless of price.
    
      Price Elasticity of Supply vs. Demand
      Price elasticity of supply refers to how responsive supply is to price changes—price elasticity of demand (PED) refers to how responsive demand is to price changes.
      While price elasticity of supply is related to producer behavior, where producers increase and decrease supply due to price, price elasticity of demand is related to consumer behavior. The theory behind PED is that the higher prices rise, the less demand there will be from consumers.

      What Does Elasticity of Prices Mean?
      Elasticity of prices refers to how much supply and/or demand for a good changes as its price changes. Highly elastic goods see their supply or demand change rapidly with relatively small price changes.

      Why Do Suppliers Increase Production When Prices Rise?
      Rising prices often signal that demand is outpacing supply for a given product, meaning that the market could absorb more supply. Moreover, firms can profit by selling more goods at relatively higher prices, at least until the newly available supply leads prices to fall back down.

      What Does Perfectly Inelastic Mean?
      When a good has zero elasticity, it is called "perfectly" inelastic. This means the product's supply and/or demand will not change, even as its price changes. Raw materials that are scarce or consumer staples that are needed for basic survival are often cited as examples of near-perfectly inelastic goods.

      The Bottom Line
      Companies hope to keep their price elasticity of supply high to remain nimble should the price of their products shift. That is, they want to be able to capture more profit should prices rise or trim production should prices fall. To help boost PES, companies can do several things.
      These include improving the technology used, such as upgrading equipment and software to improve efficiency. Improved capacity and capacity on hand also boost PES, including boosting the stock on hand and expanding storage space and systems. Beyond that, improving how products are shipped and distributed can help. PES can also be increased by ensuring products can last long while stored.

      Retailers are cheering after shoppers spent big on gifts and decor in the days after they gobbled up turkey and stuffing.
      But the strong showing does not necessarily mean those companies will have blowout success in their all-important holiday quarter.
      Online spending shot up by nearly 8% year over year to $38 billion during the five-day period from Thanksgiving Day to Cyber Monday, according to Adobe Analytics. A record high of 200.4 million shoppers went to retailers’ stores and websites over the same period, according to a survey by the National Retail Federation. And Ulta Beauty and Foot Locker’s shares rose this week, after the companies reported better-than-expected earnings and a strong start to holiday spending on sneakers, makeup and more.
      But some unique factors may have driven those early sales, including wider adoption of online shopping, deeper discounting levels and cooler temperatures in many parts of the U.S. That’s raised questions about whether consumers’ appetite to spend will continue throughout the critical retail season — or taper off into a more pronounced lull between Black Friday and the final rush before Christmas.
      Ulta is in one of the hottest categories for retail, as beauty continues to defy weaker discretionary spending trends. Yet even Ulta CEO Dave Kimbell was quick to point out this week on the company’s earnings call that retail’s biggest weeks are ahead.
      He said Ulta and its beauty competitors will have higher promotional levels than a year ago, as they cater to budget-minded customers.
      The NRF has tempered expectations, too, relative to recent years. The industry’s major trade group predicts 3% to 4% year-over-year growth in holiday-related spending from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31. That’s roughly in line with the average annual growth before the boom of the pandemic years.
      On a call this week, NRF CEO Matt Shay said the season is on track to meet that estimate — even after shoppers blew past the trade group’s turnout expectations for the five-day Thanksgiving weekend.
      Here’s a look at three key factors that contributed to Black Friday weekend:
    
      Shoppers flock online
      Instead of dashing to the mall after Thanksgiving dinner or lining up outside stores for doorbuster deals on Black Friday morning, more Americans are filling up shopping carts from their couches.
      Online shopping still drives just a fraction of overall holiday spending, even after the cooped-up years of the pandemic — giving it plenty of room to grow. About 1 in 5 retail dollars are spent online, according to Adobe Analytics. Only about 30% of overall holiday sales last year took place online, through apps or in other locations that aren’t physical stores, according to the NRF.
      Consumers spent $109.3 billion online from Nov. 1 through Cyber Monday this year, according to Adobe Analytics. That’s a 7.3% jump compared with the same period last year.
      It’s an even sharper jump from pre-pandemic in 2019. Consumers spent $81.5 billion online during the stretch from Nov. 1 through Cyber Monday that year. The period this year had a few extra days since Thanksgiving was later in 2019 than in 2023, but illustrates the bigger embrace of e-commerce.
      Adobe’s data covers more than 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail websites, 100 million unique items and 18 total product categories.
      One reason for the shift? Some major retailers that used to draw shoppers on the evening of Thanksgiving are now shut. The closures of Walmart, Target, Best Buy and other retailers on Thanksgiving is one of the pandemic’s legacies.
      Plus, in a year when Americans are more budget-minded, online can be the better way to shop, said Vivek Pandya, a lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights. Comparing prices is easier to do by opening multiple web browsers and apps rather than driving from store to store, he said.
      “The focus is on price and value and the consumer has been very strategic,” he said.
      It’s too soon to say if the higher online shopping total so far this season means holiday shoppers will spend more overall year over year — or if more of their purchases are just moving to websites and apps. Adobe does not track in-store purchases, Pandya said.
      Adobe predicts that full holiday season online spending from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31 will hit $221.8 billion, which would be a nearly 5% year-over-year jump. If the estimate ends up being correct, that means shoppers still have a little more than half of their online holiday spending to go.
      The NRF said this week that its survey found about half of consumers’ online and in-store holiday shopping remains.
    
      A hunger for deals
      The desire for deals is an early and clear theme of the season.
      After more than a year of paying higher prices for nearly everything including milk, gas and housing, U.S. shoppers have shown that a compelling price cut is one of the best motivators.
      Black Friday and Cyber Monday have become synonymous with deep discounts, which may explain the outsized shopper turnout and online spending.
      On Cyber Monday, for instance, consumers saw discounts peak at 31% for electronics, 27% for toys, 23% on apparel and 21% on furniture, according to Adobe.
      Those price cuts in electronics, apparel and furniture were higher than Cyber Monday a year ago. Toys, on the other hand, had lower discounting levels than the last Cyber Monday.
      Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo, said it’s a mistake for investors to extrapolate that heightened Black Friday weekend spending means that the American consumer is healthy. Instead, he described it as the “last hurrah” before a recession that Wells Fargo predicts will take place in the first half of 2024.
      He said higher credit card balances, increased costs of borrowing and the risk that the U.S. Federal Reserve may keep raising interest rates to fight inflation could spur a downturn.
      “People are just about tapped out, but [with] the holiday season, people are willing to even further extend themselves,” he said.
      Reality may also hit as consumers must pay off those holiday purchases.
      Americans are financing purchases in new ways, along with swiping credit and debit cards. Use of buy now, pay later hit an all-time high on Cyber Monday, according to Adobe. It contributed $940 million in online spend, a nearly 43% jump year over year. Shoppers who used the payment option also put more items in their carts, as the number of items purchased rose 11% year over year.
      Taking on credit card debt this holiday season will come at a steeper price, too, if consumers carry a balance from month to month because of higher interest rates.
    
      A well-timed cold snap
      In many parts of the country, shoppers got away with postponing purchases of sweaters, hats, jackets and other cold-weather gear thanks to an unseasonably warm fall.
      Yet Black Friday weekend brought chillier temperatures in major cities such as New York City — the kind of cold snap that retailers root for.
      Over the past two months, companies including Levi Strauss and Macy’s spoke about the challenge of milder weather.
      Macy’s CEO-elect Tony Spring told investors on an earnings call in mid-November that “the weather was a little warmer than we would have liked,” but stores adapted with merchandise that could transition from season to season.
      Levi CEO Chip Bergh said unseasonably warm weather hurt sales of its denim at stores such as Walmart, J.C. Penney and Macy’s.
      “It’s hard to sell blue jeans when it’s 110 degrees outside,” he said on a call with CNBC in October.
      Colder weather over Black Friday weekend laid the groundwork for bigger sales, said Scott Bernhardt, president at Planalytics, a predictive demand and analytics company that tracks the influence of weather on retail spending. A cold snap typically motivates spending, since it puts shoppers into a holiday mood and helps their shopping list better match the seasonal merchandise that retailers have displayed in stores, he said.
      Retailers may not get as lucky in the weeks ahead, Bernhardt said.

      The U.S. economy grew at an even stronger pace then previously indicated in the third quarter, the product of better-than-expected business investment and stronger government spending, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday.
      Gross domestic product, a measure of all goods and services produced during the three-month period, accelerated at a 5.2% annualized pace, the department’s second estimate showed. The acceleration topped the initial 4.9% reading and was better than the 5% forecast from economists polled by Dow Jones.
      Primarily, the upward revision came from increases in nonresidential fixed investment, which includes structures, equipment and intellectual property. The category showed a rise of 1.3%, which still marked a sharp downward shift from previous quarters.
      Government spending also helped boost the Q3 estimate, rising 5.5% for the July-through-September period.
      However, consumer spending saw a downward revision, now rising just 3.6%, compared with 4% in the initial estimate.
      There was some mixed news on the inflation front. The personal consumption expenditures price index, a gauge the Federal Reserve follows closely, increased 2.8% for the period, a 0.1 percentage point downward revision. However, the chain-weighted price index increased 3.6%, a 0.1 percentage point upward move.
      Corporate profits accelerated 4.3% during the period, up sharply from the 0.8% gain in the second quarter.

      The U.S. economy is “back to normal” for the first time in two decades, but the market is getting ahead of the likely pace of interest rate cuts, according to IBM Vice Chairman Gary Cohn.
      The market is narrowly pricing a first rate reduction from the Federal Reserve in May 2024, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool, with around 100 basis points of cuts expected across the year.
      The central bank in September paused its historically aggressive monetary tightening cycle with the Fed funds rate target range at 5.25-5.5%, up from just 0.25-0.5% in March 2022.
      Cohn — who was chief economic advisor to former U.S. President Donald Trump from 2017 to 2018 and is a former director of the National Economic Council — does not see the Fed starting to unwind its position until at least the second half of next year, after similar moves from other major central banks that began hiking sooner.
      “You don’t want to be early to leave when you’re the last one to come to the party. You have to be the last one to leave the party, so the Fed is going to be the last one to leave this party,” Cohn told CNBC’s Dan Murphy on stage at the Abu Dhabi Finance Week conference on Wednesday.
      “The economy will clearly turn down before the Fed had starts to cut interest rates, so I strongly believe that for the first half of ’24, we will see no rate activity in the Fed. Maybe [in the third quarter], we’ll start hearing rumblings of some forward guidance of lower rates.”
    
      The U.S. consumer price index increased 3.2% in October from a year ago, unchanged from the previous month but down considerably from a pandemic-era peak of 9.1% in June 2022.
      Despite the sharp rise in interest rates, the U.S. economy has so far remained resilient and avoided a widely predicted recession, fueling bets that the Fed can engineer a fabled “soft landing” by bringing inflation down to its 2% target over the medium term without triggering an economic downturn.
      Cohn highlighted that U.S. consumer debt has soared to record highs of over $1 trillion, and that consumer spending is persisting despite tightening financial conditions. He said the consumer and the broader economy is “back to a normal, but we all forgot what normal is.”
      “We haven’t seen normal for over two decades. We went through a decade plus of zero interest rates, we went through a decade of quantitative easing, zero interest rates and the Fed trying to see if they could create inflation,” he said.
    
      “We’ve gone from the Fed not being able to create inflation — we now know the answer, the Fed can’t create inflation, but the market can — to us trying to unwind a shorter term inflationary shock. We’re back into a normal world.”
      He noted that the 100-year average for 10-year U.S. Treasury yields is around 4.5%, and that the 10-year yield has moderated from the 16-year high of 5% logged in October to around 4.3% as of Wednesday morning. Meanwhile, inflation is “running back towards the mean” of between 2% and 2.5%.
      “So every piece of economic data, if you look, is sort of heading back towards its very long term average. If you look at these over 100-year generational cycles, we seem to be running into that phase right now,” Cohn added.

      Inflation was flat in October from the previous month, providing a hopeful sign that stubbornly high prices are easing their grip on the U.S. economy and giving a potential green light to the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest rates.
      The consumer price index, which measures a broad basket of commonly used goods and services, increased 3.2% from a year ago despite being unchanged for the month, according to seasonally adjusted numbers from the Labor Department on Tuesday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for respective readings of 0.1% and 3.3%.
      The headline CPI had increased 0.4% in September.

      Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI increased 0.2% and 4%, against the forecast of 0.3% and 4.1%. The annual level was the lowest in two years, down from 4.1% in September, though still well above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. However, Fed officials have stressed that they want to see a series of declines in core readings, which has been the case since April.
      Markets spiked following the news. The Dow Jones Industrial Average roared higher by nearly 500 points as Treasury yields fell sharply. Traders also took any potential Fed rate hikes almost completely off the table, according to CME Group data.
      “The Fed looks smart for effectively ending its tightening cycle as inflation continues to slow. Yields are down significantly as the last of investors not convinced the Fed is done are likely throwing in the towel,” said Bryce Doty, portfolio manager at Sit Fixed Income Advisors.
      The flat reading on the headline CPI came as energy prices declined 2.5% for the month, offsetting a 0.3% increase in the food index. It was the slowest monthly pace since July 2022.
    
      Shelter costs, a key component in the index, rose 0.3% in October, half the gain in September as the year-over-year increase eased to 6.7%. Within the category, owners equivalent rent, which gauges what property owners could command for rent, increased 0.4%. A subcategory that includes hotel and motel pricing dropped 2.9%.
      “This is a game changer,” Paul McCulley, former chief economist at Pimco and now an adjunct professor at Georgetown University, said on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street.” “We’re having a day of rational exuberance, because the data clearly show what we’ve been waiting for for a long time, which is a crack in the shelter component.”
      Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee called the report “slow but clear progress” on getting inflation back to healthy levels.
      Vehicle costs, which had been a key inflation component during the spike in 2021-22, fell on the month. New vehicle prices declined 0.1%, while used vehicle prices were off 0.8% and were down 7.1% from a year ago.
      Airfares, another closely watched component, declined 0.9% and are off 13.2% annually. Motor vehicle insurance, however, saw a 1.9% increase and was up 19.2% from a year ago.
      The report comes as markets are closely watching the Fed for its next steps in a battle against persistent inflation that began in March 2022. The central bank ultimately increased its key borrowing rate 11 times for a total of 5.25 percentage points.
      While markets overwhelmingly believe the Fed is done tightening monetary policy, the data of late has sent conflicting signals.
      Nonfarm payrolls in October increased by just 150,000, indicating the labor market finally is showing signs that it is reacting to Fed efforts to correct a supply-demand imbalance that has been a contributing inflation factor.
      Labor costs have been increasing at a much slower pace over the past year and a half as productivity has been on the rise this year.
      Real average hourly earnings — adjusted for inflation — increased 0.2% on a monthly basis in October but were up just 0.8% from a year ago, according to a separate Labor Department release.
      More broadly speaking, gross domestic product surged in the third quarter, rising at a 4.9% annualized pace, though most economists expect the growth rate to slow considerably.
      Fed Chair Jerome Powell last week added to market anxiety when he said he and his fellow policymakers remain unconvinced that they’ve done enough to get inflation back down to a 2% annual rate and won’t hesitate to raise rates if more progress isn’t made.
      “Despite the deceleration, the Fed will likely continue to speak hawkishly and will keep warning investors not to be complacent about the Fed’s resolve to get inflation down to the long-run 2% target,” said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial.
      Even if the Fed is done hiking, there’s more uncertainty over how long it will keep benchmark rates at their highest level in some 22 years.

      The consumer took a spending break ahead of the holiday season, with October retail sales, excluding autos and gas, falling by 0.08%, and core retail, which also removes restaurants, declining by 0.03%, according to the new CNBC/NRF Retail Monitor.
      The new Retail Monitor, debuting Monday, is a joint product of CNBC and the National Retail Federation based on data from Affinity Solutions, a leading consumer purchase insights company. The data is sourced from more than 9 billion annual credit and debit card transactions collected and anonymized by Affinity and accounting for more than $500 billion in sales. The cards are issued by more than 1,400 financial institutions.
      The data differs from the Census Bureau’s retail sales report as it is the result of actual consumer purchases, while the Census relies on survey data. The government data is frequently revised as additional survey data becomes available. The CNBC/NRF Retail Monitor is not revised as it’s calculated from actual transactions during the month. It is, however, seasonally adjusted, using the same program employed by Census.
      “The CNBC/NRF Retail Monitor will modernize how retail sales are tracked and measured, and Affinity Solutions’ vast dataset of how, what and where the consumer is spending will identify how key demographics and channels are performing for the industry generally and for specific retail sectors,″ said NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay.
      “Our audience, investors and executives alike, will now be armed with dynamic insights that go beyond headline numbers to show emerging trends and critical detail,” CNBC Senior Vice President of Business News Dan Colarusso said.

      Weakness in electronics and furniture
      The October data shows a cooling of consumer spending, in line with the consensus of Wall Street forecasts. Year over year, overall retail and core retail sales are both up 2.6%.
      The October data showed weakness in gas station sales, electronics and appliances, and furniture and home stores. There was strength in sporting goods and hobby stores and non-store retails, or internet sales, along with health and personal care.
      Starting modestly before the Covid pandemic, and accelerating amid the outbreak, economists turned to real and high-frequency private sector data to gauge the economy. In some cases, it was due to the absence of government data, with some agencies unable to gather information and others finding response rates limited. In other cases, economists looked to data that was not readily available from government sources, like subway ridership data or how much consumer spending occurred “with card not present” to gauge whether Americans continued to shun shopping in person.
      While the pandemic passed, the move toward actual, high-frequency and private sector data has continued to expand.
      “The Retail Monitor heralds a new era of retail intelligence, where data isn’t just a resource – it’s a roadmap to understanding and engaging with the modern consumer,” Affinity Solutions founder and CEO Jonathan Silver said. Affinity is also a leading provider of data to Wall Street.
      In coming months, the Retail Monitor will provide demographic breakdowns of spending by age, income and geography.

      The world’s major central banks paused their interest rate hiking cycles in recent weeks and with data suggesting economies are softening, markets are turning their attention to the first round of cuts.
      The U.S. Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and the Bank of England dramatically hiked rates over the last 18 months in a bid to tame runaway inflation.
      The Fed on Wednesday held benchmark interest rates steady at a target range of 5.25%-5.5% for the second consecutive meeting after ending a string of 11 hikes in September.
      Though Chairman Jerome Powell has been keen to reiterate that the Fed’s work on inflation is not yet done, the annual rise in the consumer price index came in at 3.7% in September, down from a pandemic-era peak of 9.1% in June 2022.
      Yet despite Powell’s refusal to close the door on further increases in order to finish the job on inflation, markets interpreted the central bank’s tone as a slightly dovish pivot and rallied on the back of the decision.
      The market is now narrowly pricing a first 25 basis point cut from the Fed on May 1, 2024, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool, with 100 basis points of cuts now expected by the end of next year.
      Since last week’s decision, U.S. nonfarm payrolls came in softer than expected for October, with job creation below trend, unemployment rising slightly and a further deceleration in wages. Although headline inflation remained unchanged at 3.7% annually from August to September, the core figure came down to 4.1%, having roughly halved over the last 12 months.
      “Core PCE, which is the Fed’s preferred inflation metric, is even lower at 2.5% (3-month, annualized),” noted analysts at DBRS Morningstar.
      “The lagged effects of a cooler housing market should reinforce the disinflationary trend over the next few months.”
      But despite the dovish data points, short-term U.S. Treasurys reversed course to sell off on Monday, which Deutsche Bank’s Jim Reid chalked up to investors beginning to “wonder if last week’s narrative about rate cuts was overdone.”
      “The U.S. economy is also proving more resilient than the U.K. and euro zone,” he said.
      “For instance, market pricing for the Fed now implies a 16% chance of another rate hike, up from 11% on Friday,” Reid said in an email Tuesday.
      “Moreover, the rate priced in by the December 2024 meeting was up +12.4bps to 4.47%. So there was a clear, albeit partial unwinding of last week’s moves.”
      Reid also highlighted that this is the seventh time this cycle that markets have notably reacted on dovish speculation.
      “Clearly rates aren’t going to keep going up forever, but on the previous 6 occasions we saw hopes for near-term rate cuts dashed every time. Note that we’ve still got above-target inflation in every G7 country,” he added.

      The ECB
      The European Central Bank late last month ended its run of 10 consecutive hikes to keep its benchmark interest rate at a record high of 4%, with euro zone inflation falling to a two-year low of 2.9% in October and the core figure also continuing to decline.
      The market is also pricing almost 100 basis point of cuts for the ECB by December 2024, but the first 25 basis point reduction is mostly priced in for April, with economic weakness across the 20-member common currency bloc fueling bets that the central bank will be the first to start unwinding its tight policy position.
      Gilles Moëc, group chief economist at AXA, said October’s inflation print confirmed and amplified the message that “disinflation has come in earnest to Europe,” vindicating the ECB’s “new-found prudence.”
      “Of course, the current disinflation does not preclude the possibility that a ‘line of resistance’ would be found well above the ECB’s target. Yet, the confirmation that the euro area was flirting with recession last summer reduces this probability,” Moëc said in a research note Monday.
      After the October meeting, ECB President Christine Lagarde batted away the suggestion of rate cuts, but National Bank of Greece Governor Yannis Stournaras has since openly discussed the possibility of a reduction in the middle of 2024 provided inflation stabilizes below 3%.
      “This implicitly advocates a forward-looking version of monetary policy which takes lags into consideration to calibrate its stance. In clear, waiting for inflation to reach 2% before cutting rates would be ‘overkill,’” Moëc said.
      “There is no doubt in our mind that the current dataflow is clearly favouring the doves, but the hawks are far from having given up the fight.”

      The Bank of England
      The Bank of England on Thursday kept its main policy rate unchanged at 5.25% for a second consecutive meeting after ending a run of 14 straight hikes in September.
      However, minutes from last week’s meeting reiterated the Monetary Policy Committee’s expectations that rates will need to stay higher for longer, with the U.K. CPI holding steady at 6.7% in September. Despite this, the market on Monday was pricing around 60 basis points of cuts by December 2024, albeit starting in the second half of the year.
      BNP Paribas economists on Thursday noted an “eye-catching” addition to the MPC’s guidance, which said its latest projections indicated that “monetary policy was likely to need to be restrictive for an extended period of time.”
      “Governor Andrew Bailey’s comments at the press conference indicated that this guidance was not intended as push-back on the market-implied policy rate path that underpins its latest forecasts, where a 25bp cut is not fully priced in until the second half of 2024,” they said.
      “Instead, the intention was to indicate that cuts are not likely to feature as part of the conversation any time soon.”
      At Thursday’s news conference, Bailey emphasized the upside risks to the bank’s inflation projections, rather than entertaining any suggestion of cuts on the horizon.
      “While we don’t think it is necessarily indicative of a high risk of further hikes in the near term, we read it as a further sign that the MPC is not considering rate cuts and will not do so for a while,” BNP Paribas added.

      Where a child grows up in the U.S. is becoming an increasingly critical component toward determining their future economic status.
      Research from economists at Brown University, Harvard University and the U.S. Census Bureau shows that the numerous variables that define neighborhoods — such as the quality of their school districts, poverty rates and conditions that influence social capital in a community — all have lasting impacts on children’s future income. The research’s findings were presented earlier this year comparing mobility levels around the world at a World Bank conference.
      While it may seem obvious that a good neighborhood may translate into better chances for success in adulthood, it also highlights that being immersed in these areas at a young age is important — and that sociological forces, while difficult to quantify, play an important role in economic prospects.
      These insights could help to shift the tide against worsening rates of intergenerational mobility in the U.S. by informing policymakers as to which decisions could be the most influential in shaping upward prospects, according to John Friedman, professor of economics at Brown University and co-director of Opportunity Insights. Given the geographic span of the U.S., intergenerational mobility varies across a national scale. Yet even when focusing on just an intra-city level, mobility can differ widely between neighborhoods across the street from each other, Friedman said.
      Friedman and his colleagues at Opportunity Insights research program created the Opportunity Atlas, which tracks children’s outcomes in adulthood using U.S. Census and tax data. The data shows a child can earn an average of $56,000 as an adult if they grow up in one neighborhood, versus just $33,000 if they grow up in an adjacent area. 
      “It’s not just that exposure to these local places is incredibly important. It seems [that] exposure during childhood is the most important thing,” Friedman said. 
      While moving to a “better” neighborhood can shape their earnings as adults, the age at which a child moves is also critical in realizing these benefits, Friedman found. The older a child is at the time of the move, the lower their projected income at age 35. At age 24, no income gains can be measured from moving to a higher-mobility neighborhood. 
      Although it’s difficult to pinpoint all the various characteristics of high-mobility neighborhoods, these areas hold certain common characteristics. These include lower poverty rates, more stable family structure, greater social capital and better school quality.
      “Policies tend to be more impactful in people’s trajectories when people are kids, but I don’t think there’s a sharp cut-off,” said Friedman. 

      Measures of mobility
      There are two measures of mobility: relative and absolute. The former measures the chances of rising to the top of the country’s income distribution and has remained stable in the U.S. The latter gauges the chances that a child born into poverty rises to a higher standard of living. 
      “We have less [relative] mobility in this country than we do in other developed nations, especially in Europe and developing European countries. And so even though relative mobility haven’t gotten much better, or much worse over time, it is harder to move from the bottom to the top,” said Kreg Steven Brown, director of economic mobility policy at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. “We are thought to be the country of the American dream, [where] once you start from the bottom, you move to the top. But that’s just not really what we see.”
      In the U.S., there’s 13.1% average probability that a child of parents in the bottom half of the income distribution can make it to the top quartile, according to data from the World Bank. In Denmark, that probability rises to more than 20%. China, South Africa and Morocco also rank higher than the U.S.
      Absolute mobility across generations has been in continuous decline in the U.S. since 1980, according to Opportunity Insights. Concurrently, economic inequality has risen over this period. While slowing economic growth compared to developing economies can be cited as a factor, the American economy is becoming relatively immobile compared to its developed-economy peers. 
      The “Great Gatsby Curve” demonstrates the correlation between income inequality and intergenerational earnings “stickiness.” Higher levels of income elasticity correlate to less upward mobility.
      The curve shows that, compared to other developed nations such as Germany, Canada, Japan, France and Scandinavian countries, not only is wealth much more concentrated amongst a small group in the U.S. — there is also less upward mobility.

      Possibilities from education
      Inequality and mobility remain tricky subjects for economists to measure. Collecting data sets that span over a generation is difficult, and with so many social factors at force — racial segregation, gender, education, household structure, environment — identifying causation, correlation and confounding variables in a study continue to pose challenges.
      “It’s really hard to know what works, because we don’t really have the time to wait a generation to see if [a] particular intervention designed in [a] way actually made the change you want to see,” said Brown.
      However, education has been underscored as one of the greater openers toward greater mobility.
      “One of the biggest equalizers, or mobility-enhancing policies, that you can do is to you provide good-quality education without a burden of debt,” said Juan Palomino, a research scholar at Universidad Complutense de Madrid.
      Education also stands out because of all the pre-existing policy applications that can directly improve quality and resource allocation relative to other factors, Friedman added. “It’s a policy area that’s very impactful, and there’s also a lot of policy levers that one could pull that would increase, kids’ long-term outcomes.”
      The U.S. only ranks behind England for having the world’s highest university tuition fees, according to data from the OECD. Tuition and fees have also more than doubled over the last 20 years and outstanding student loans total $1.75 trillion, as of the third quarter of 2021.
      Friedman noted that while improvements could be made to the U.S. financial aid system. Data on aid awards from the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation given to Nebraska high school graduates showed only about an 8% increase, from a base of 62%, in the fraction of people who went to a four-year college.
      Notably, the Biden Administration’s student loan forgiveness plan was struck down by the Supreme Court in June, denying millions of borrowers the chance to have their debts reduced.
      “College is much more expensive than it used to be, but it remains [about] the single best investment most people can make,” said Friedman.

      The European Central Bank ended its run of interest rate hikes on Thursday, despite new upside risks to inflation from oil markets amid the Israel-Hamas war.
      The key rate is set to remain at a record high of 4%, where it was brought through 10 consecutive hikes that began in July 2022 and pushed rates back into positive territory for the first time since 2011.
      The Governing Council said recent information confirmed its medium-term outlook for inflation at 2.1%.
      “Inflation is still expected to stay too high for too long, and domestic price pressures remain strong. At the same time, inflation dropped markedly in September, including due to strong base effects, and most measures of underlying inflation have continued to ease,” it said in a statement.
      Markets had priced in a more than 98% chance of a hold, after the ECB gave a strong indication at its previous meeting that rates had peaked.
      The euro was 0.15% lower against the British pound at 1:40 p.m. London time, declining slightly after the announcement. The European currency was 0.2% down against the U.S. dollar.

      Rate cut discussion ‘premature’
      The bank’s September hike was described as a dovish rise, as the ECB said rates had reached levels that would substantially contribute to the fight against inflation in a timely manner, if “maintained for a sufficiently long duration.”
      It repeated this message on Thursday and said that its decision-making continues to rely on data.
      ECB Governing Council members have in interviews stressed a ‘higher for longer’ message on rates, while insisting that an inflationary shock could spur them to hike again, as they seek to dampen market expectations of rate cuts starting in the middle of next year.
      Asked how long rates need to stay at current levels, ECB President Christine Lagarde told CNBC’s Annette Weisbach, “We refer to timely manner, sufficiently long. But in the same breath, I say we shall be data-dependent. At this point of our fight against inflation and after 10 successive hikes, now is not the time for forward guidance.”
      Lagarde said the topic of rate cuts was not discussed by the Governing Council.
      “Even having a discussion on a cut is totally, totally premature. For the moment we are saying we are steady, we have to hold,” she said.
      The ECB needs to assess data in areas such as wage negotioations that will not be released until 2024, she added.
    
      Higher for longer
      The ECB’s decision is in line with major central banks around the world, which are widely considered to have already reached or to be on the brink of peak interest rates. The Bank of England, Swiss National Bank and U.S. Federal Reserve all opted to hold rates in September.
      The ECB needs monetary policy to remain sufficiently tight to meet its current inflation forecasts of 5.6% this year, 3.2% next year and 2.1% in the “medium term.”
      However, the central bank must also reckon with persistently weak business activity and tepid euro zone growth forecasts of 0.7% in 2023 and 1% in 2024, as former EU powerhouse Germany stagnates.
      Lagarde confirmed it is also assessing volatility in the bond market, where yields have risen sharply, reflecting a global sell-off.
      Marcus Brookes, chief investment officer at Quilter Investors, said risks to inflation remained in wage growth and in energy prices going up as a result of uncertainty in the Middle East.
      “Going forward, like other central banks, it will say the market needs to expect higher interest rates for longer, with the door being left open should we see inflation spike again,” Brookes said in an emailed note.
      “However, given the stagnating economy and the fact other central banks have moved into a holding pattern, something very unexpected would need to happen for rates to be raised again. The pressure will quickly shift to cutting rates given the lack of economic growth.”

      Prices that consumers pay for a wide variety of goods and services increased at a slightly faster-than-expected pace in September, keeping inflation in the spotlight for policymakers.
      The consumer price index, a closely followed inflation gauge, increased 0.4% on the month and 3.7% from a year ago, according to a Labor Department report Thursday. That compared with respective Dow Jones estimates of 0.3% and 3.6%. Headline inflation increased 0.6% in August.
      Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the so-called core CPI increased 0.3% on the month and 4.1% on a 12-month basis, both exactly in line with expectations. Policymakers place more weight on the core numbers as they tend to be better predictors of long-term trends. Core inflation also increased 0.3% in August, when it was up 4.3% from the previous 12 months.
      In keeping with recent trends, shelter costs were the main factor in the inflation increase. The index for shelter, which makes up about one-third of the CPI weighting, accelerated 0.6% for the month and 7.2% from a year ago. On a monthly basis, shelter accounted for more than half the rise in the CPI, the Labor Department said.
      Energy costs rose 1.5%, including a 2.1% pickup in gasoline prices and 8.5% in fuel oil, and food was up 0.2% for the third month in a row. On a 12-month basis, food costs climbed 3.7%, including a 6% increase for food away from home, while energy costs were off 0.5%.
      Services prices, considered a key for the longer-run direction for inflation, also posted a 0.6% gain excluding energy services, and were up 5.7% on a 12-month basis. Vehicle prices were mixed, with new vehicles up 0.3% and used down 2.5%. Used vehicle prices, a big driver of inflation in the early days of the Covid pandemic, were down 8% from a year ago.
      Among the major CPI components, the other main decliners were apparel (-0.8%) and medical care commodities (-0.3%). Medical care services increased 0.3% on the month but were down 2.6% on an annual basis.
      Markets showed only a modest reaction to the report. Stocks edged higher at the open, while Treasury yields came off previous lows, with longer-duration notes little changed.

      The CPI increase meant worker wages fell in real terms.
      Real average hourly earnings dropped 0.2% on the month, owing to the difference between the inflation rate and the 0.2% gain in nominal earnings, the Labor Department said in a separate report. On a yearly basis, earnings were up 0.5%.
      “Just because the rate of inflation is stable for now doesn’t mean its weight isn’t increasing every month on family budgets,” said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union. “That shelter and food costs rose particularly is especially painful.”
      In other economic news Thursday, the Labor Department reported that initial jobless claims totaled 209,000, unchanged from the previous week and just below the 210,000 estimate.
      The CPI report comes with Federal Reserve officials contemplating their next policy moves.
      Minutes from the Fed’s September meeting, released Wednesday, reflected divisions within the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. The meeting concluded with the committee opting not to raise interest rates, but the summary showed lingering concern about inflation and worries that upside risks remain.
      Since then, however, Treasury yields have jumped, at one point hitting 16-year highs.
      Multiple Fed officials have said that the increases could negate the need for further policy tightening, and markets now are pricing only a small chance that the central bank votes to hike before the end of the year. Market pricing further indicates that the Fed will shave about 0.75 percentage point off its key borrowing rate before the end of 2024.
      Recent days, though, have brought mixed news on where inflation is heading.
      The Labor Department said Wednesday that prices at the wholesale level increased 0.5% in September, pushing the 12-month rate to 2.2%, the highest since April and above the Fed’s goal of 2% inflation.

      Consumers are still splurging for a side of fries with their meals. That can have a positive read-through for the economy.
      Frozen potato supplier Lamb Weston Holdings has seen the share of consumers ordering the iconic side with fast food meals — known as the fry attachment rate — remain above pre-pandemic levels, CEO Tom Werner told analysts on the company’s earnings call Thursday. That could indicate a resilient consumer even as inflation has pinched pocketbooks and fears of a recession have mounted.
      “The global frozen potato category continues to be solid with overall demand and supply balanced,” Werner said. “Fry attachment rate, which is the rate at which consumers order fries when visiting a restaurant or other food service outlets across our key markets, [has] remained largely steady and above pre-pandemic levels.”
      When consumers feel financial pressure, a natural reaction is to cut back on spending through measures such as trading down to cheaper brands or cutting extraneous expenses. In the case of Lamb Weston and fast-food companies, that can manifest in the form of customers opting to skip fries or other side orders in a bid to keep spending restricted.
      The impact of inflation can affect the business in ways other than fry sales, of course. Lamb Weston saw little change in total traffic in key U.S. markets, but evidence of a shift in consumer behavior was there: Growth in quick-service food providers, which are typically more affordable, balanced out declines seen in full-service and casual-dining restaurants.
      Werner also said inflation can continue to drive up costs for the company, specifically related to potato contract prices.
      He pointed to June as a source of restaurant traffic weakness seen in the fiscal fourth quarter. But Werner said it has been reassuring to see trends improve since then, while remaining confident in the ability of the company’s potato offerings to weather an economic slowdown.
      “We suspect that restaurant traffic trends will be volatile in the near term as high interest rates, high inflation and uncertainty continues to affect consumer,” Werner said. “That said, frozen potato demand has proven resilient during the most challenging economic times, and we continue to be confident in the long-term growth prospect for the global category.”
      Lamb Weston stock jumped more than 9% in Thursday’s session. The stock has performed almost in line with the broader market in 2023, up almost 11% since the year began.
